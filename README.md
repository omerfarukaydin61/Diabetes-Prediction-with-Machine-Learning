# Diabetes prediction using PIMA Indians dataset

Before clicking anything please read this!

We implemented 4 methods to predict whether a person has or will develop diabetes or not given some medical data about that person. 

These are 4 models implemented by two people currently. Decision Trees and Random Forest by Emre Hakan Erdemir; Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron by Ömer Faruk Aydın.

You can see the implementation and interpretation of the first two in the notebook called 'Emre Hakan Erdemir'.

You can see the implementation and interpretation of the latter two in the notebook called 'Omer Faruk Aydin'.
